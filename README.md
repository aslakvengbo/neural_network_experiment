# neural_network_experiment
The experiment test how the number of neurons and learning rate affects the performance of the implemented model, using the MNIST dataset. The results are saves as a pandas data frame. Then a 4D vizualisation is made (see [all_data_plot.html](https://github.com/aslakvengbo/neural_network_experiment/all_data_plot) and briefly analyzed, before the best performing model out of 320 models is found.
